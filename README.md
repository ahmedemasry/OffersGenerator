## Overview
This powerful Photoshop script revolutionizes the design process by enabling the rapid generation of various designs with consistent backgrounds but different content or text. It significantly boosts efficiency, saving approximately 65% of the time typically required for such tasks and reducing storage needs by 30%.

Initially developed for a specific use case, this project has evolved into a versatile tool applicable to any design scenario. Its flexibility and adaptability make it an invaluable asset for designers seeking to streamline their workflow and achieve remarkable results in less time.

## Capabilities
- Generating different designs with the same background.
- Generating different backgrounds, text with the same layout.
