# Offers Generator

## Overview
This photoshop script is mainly used to generate any type of designs with the same background but with different content or text faster than ever.
It saves about 65% of the time and 30% of the storage needed to finish this type of tasks.

The project was made for a particular case, but after that, it was developed to be generic for any case.

## Cases to use it
- Generating different designs with the same background.
- Generating different backgrounds, text with the same layout.
- Generating different text for the same design. (already exists in photoshop).


## Example
Suppose we need to generate multiple images for many persons with their names and titles:

1- You need to arrange you psd file in a similar format to this image:

2- You need a *.csv sheet to describe your file names, text layers, and others:

3- The output files should be something like that. It supports 1 or 2 languages (AR,EN) at the moment, but it should support any number of languages in the future.
